#GettingAndCleaningData_FinalAssignment

##This README describes the content of the repository. It contains the files to run the analysis for the final assignment of the Coursera.org course "Getting and cleaning data":

https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome

##Content of the repository

The repository contains the following files:

run_analysis.R: this is the script which performs the analysis (details are given below)
Codebook.md: this file contains the description of the variables used in the analysis
summary_df.txt: it's the output tidy dataset
README.md: this file

##How to run the analysis

In order to run the analysis you need the reshape2 package. If you don't have it, you can install it inside an R session with the following command:

install.packages("reshape2",dependencies = TRUE)
To reproduce the result of summary_df.txt one has to run the following command in an R session:

source('run_analysis.R')

##Description of the analysis

The analysis starts from downloading the datasets from the following website:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


The measurements stored in the files refer to the data from accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded in smartphones worn by two groups of "train" and "test" people. More information is given at the website and inside the Codebook.md file.

The analysis proceeds as follows:

the script checks if the input dataset is present in the directory: if not it downloads and unzips it;


the features data.frame is created by reading the "features.txt" file (using read.table). This data.frame contains the on the (561) variables measured by the accelerometers and gyroscopes;


the activities data.frame is created by reading the "activity_labels.txt" file;


for the "train" set, the "X_train.txt", the "y_train.txt" and the "subject_train.txt" files are read and imported as data.frames. For the X_train data.frame only the features related to mean and standard deviation are retained. The 3 data.frames are collapsed to one data.frame called train by using the cbind function;


the same operation as in 4 is repeated for the test dataset;


the train and test data.frame are merged using rbind into a single dataset called merged;


the activity name is added to the merged data.frame using the merge function;


a molten (or narrow) data.frame (called molten) is created from the merged data.frame using subjectId and activityName as id.vars;


the final aggregation to create the output dataset (called out_df) is done using the dcast function of the reshape2 package, specifying fun.aggregate = mean.
